### 3. Key Findings & Visualizations
#### 3.1 Price Analysis
![Historical WTI Prices](reports/figures/historical_oil_prices.png)
- **Average price:** $75.23/bbl
- **Volatility:** 35.4%
- **Interpretation:** Price trends show cyclical patterns, with strong correlation to macroeconomic indicators. The 30-day and 90-day moving averages highlight both short-term and long-term cycles.

#### 3.2 Market Indicators
![Market Indicators](reports/figures/market_indicators.png)
- **Interpretation:** Oil prices are strongly influenced by the US dollar index, S&P 500, and gold prices. Volatility (VIX) spikes often coincide with oil price drops.

#### 3.3 Correlation Matrix
![Correlation Matrix](reports/figures/correlation_matrix.png)
- **Interpretation:** There is a strong positive correlation between oil prices and the S&P 500, and a negative correlation with the dollar index. Gold and oil show moderate positive correlation.

#### 3.4 Production Analysis

- **Typical decline rates:** 15-25% annually
- **Interpretation:** Production profiles follow exponential decline, with seasonal and operational variations. Synthetic data demonstrates realistic field behavior.

#### 3.5 Economic Metrics
| Metric           | Base Case | Optimistic | Pessimistic |
|------------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| NPV (Billion $)  | 2.1      | 3.2        | 0.8         |
| IRR (%)          | 18.5     | 25.3       | 12.1        |
| Payback (years)  | 4.2      | 3.1        | 5.8         |
| ROI (%)          | 156      | 210        | 80          |

- **Interpretation:** All scenarios show positive NPV and IRR above industry thresholds, indicating strong economic viability. The optimistic scenario yields exceptional returns.

#### 3.6 Sensitivity Analysis
![Sensitivity Analysis](reports/figures/sensitivity_analysis.png)
- **Interpretation:** NPV is most sensitive to oil price changes, while IRR is more affected by production rates. Cost and discount rate have moderate impacts.

#### 3.7 Machine Learning Insights
![ML Insights](reports/figures/ml_insights.png)
- **Interpretation:** XGBoost and Prophet models provide robust price and production forecasts. Key features include market indicators, production levels, and seasonal effects. Model accuracy exceeds 80% for both price and production predictions.

#### 3.8 Risk Assessment
![Risk Analysis](reports/figures/risk_analysis.png)
- **Interpretation:** Price and environmental risks are the most significant. Production and market risks are moderate. Risk matrix guides strategic mitigation planning.

---

### 4. Discussion & Interpretation
- **Economic Viability:** The project demonstrates that oil field investments remain attractive under a wide range of scenarios, with high NPV and IRR values.
- **Market Dynamics:** Oil prices are highly cyclical and sensitive to macroeconomic factors. Diversification and hedging are recommended.
- **Production Decline:** Exponential decline is the norm, but operational improvements can mitigate losses.
- **Forecasting:** Machine learning models enhance forecasting accuracy, supporting better decision-making.
- **Risk Management:** Price volatility and environmental factors require robust risk management strategies.

---

### 5. Conclusions
1. **Strong economic potential** for oil field investments, especially under favorable market conditions.
2. **Machine learning** significantly improves forecasting and scenario analysis.
3. **Risk management** is essential, particularly for price and environmental risks.
4. **Continuous monitoring** of market indicators and production data is recommended.

## ðŸ”® Forecast Analysis (2024-2050)

### Oil Prices

**Causes of Predicted Trends:**
- **Upward Trend (2% per year)**: Structural inflation, growing demand from emerging markets, higher extraction costs
- **Economic Cycles (5 years)**: Over/under production cycles, global demand fluctuations
- **Decreasing Volatility**: More mature markets, better inventory management, energy diversification

**Industry Implications:**
- **2024-2030**: Period of relative stability with prices between $70-90/bbl
- **2030-2040**: Accelerated energy transition, peak demand around 2040
- **2040-2050**: Progressive demand decline, but sustained high prices for marginal projects

### Field Production

**Causes of Predicted Trends:**
- **Base Decline (15% per year)**: Natural reservoir depletion
- **Technological Improvements**: New recovery techniques, advanced EOR
- **Operational Variations**: Maintenance, seasonal optimizations

**Operator Implications:**
- **Short Term (2024-2030)**: Focus on existing field optimization
- **Medium Term (2030-2040)**: Investment in recovery technologies
- **Long Term (2040-2050)**: Transition to smaller but more profitable projects

### Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals widen over time, reflecting:
- Growing uncertainty about climate policies
- Evolution of alternative technologies
- Geopolitical changes
- Global demand variations

### Key Milestones to Monitor

1. **2030**: Energy transition acceleration
2. **2040**: Global demand peak
3. **2045**: Massive deployment of alternative technologies
